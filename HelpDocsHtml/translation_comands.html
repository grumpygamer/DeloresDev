Apologies if there are rough edges. <div class='line_break'></div> All text that needs to be translated should be wrapped with the <span class='inline_code'>SAY(0,"Hi there!")</span> or <span class='inline_code'>TEXT(0,"cardboard box")</span> macros depending on if the text is said by a character or just displayed on the verbs or UI. <div class='code_block'>sayLine(delores, <span class='string'>"The commodore 64 is my favorite computer."</span>)
</div>Becomes <div class='code_block'>sayLine(delores, SAY(11876,<span class='string'>"The commodore 64 is my favorite computer."</span>))
</div>This is best done by wrapping all text and leaving the id as <span class='inline_code'>0</span>, then creating a python script that goes through and finds all <span class='inline_code'>SAY(0,"...")</span> assigning a unique number and saves them to a <span class='inline_code'>.tsv</span> file.  The ids must start at <span class='inline_code'>11000</span>. <div class='line_break'></div> The <span class='inline_code'>.tsv</span> file has four columns:: <div class='code_block'>id text en loc
</div>Note that is a <span class='inline_code'>.tsv</span> (Tab Separated Values) file, not a <span class='inline_code'>.csv</span> (Comma Separated Values) file. <div class='line_break'></div> It's best if this python script is stable and can be run multiple times as you add new text without renumbering the text ids. <div class='line_break'></div> Switching languages can be done by adding an option in <span class='inline_code'>Options.dinky</span> and using that to load different Translation files. <div class='line_break'></div> Most of the fonts in Delores don't include much more than ASCII glyphs. You can supply your own TTF fonts with the characters you need or you can use <span class='inline_code'>http://www.pentacom.jp/pentacom/bitfontmaker2/</span> to upload and modify The included fonts. <div class='line_break'></div> If you want your translations to be compatible with other mods, or even make it back into the release game, don't renumber the line ids. <div class='line_break'></div> When working on a translation in the <span class='inline_code'>.tsv</span> file, resist the urge to fix typos in the English (or native) text.  These changes should be made in the source (<span class='inline_code'>.dinky</span> file) and then a new/updated extraction should be done.   This is because the English text comes from <span class='inline_code'>Translations_en.tsv</span> and not the 2nd column of (for example) <span class='inline_code'>Translations_de.tsv</span>, the player will never see the edits. <div class='line_break'></div> The 2nd column is for reference only. <div class='line_break'></div> Have fun! </div><div class='function_list'><div id='2' class='function'>useTranslation(language)<div class='desc'>Change languages</div><div class='function text'>This is called with a 2-letter language code: <span class='inline_code'>en</span>, <span class='inline_code'>de</span>, <span class='inline_code'>fr</span>, <span class='inline_code'>it</span>, etc. Technically they don't have to be 2-letter codes but for for consistency they should be when possible. You could create <span class='inline_code'>piglatin</span> files if you wanted. <div class='line_break'></div> There is a special text id of <span class='inline_code'>10000</span> that should be used to hold the text of your language in your language. <div class='code_block'>English    English
</div>or <div class='code_block'>Deutsch    German
</div>The id <span class='inline_code'>10001</span> should be used to provide a short description of the translation for display in the UI. This can be useful in distinguishing between two translation in the same language. <div class='code_block'>Traduction par Google    Translation by Google
</div>Text id's <span class='inline_code'>10000</span>-<span class='inline_code'>11000</span> should not be used as they are reserved for the system and engine. <div class='line_break'></div> If you switch languages in the middle of playing, any text already on the screen will not change until it needs to be redrawn. <div class='line_break'></div> Passing <span class='inline_code'>null</span> will turn off all translation and use the text in the source code. </div></div><div id='3' class='function'>TR(text)<div class='desc'>Translates a raw line of text</div><div class='function text'>The text must have line ids in it to be translated.  Line ids are a five digit number follow by a <span class='inline_code'>:</span> and then the original (English in this case) text. <div class='line_break'></div> After the macro expands, the code <span class='inline_code'>sayLine(SAY(11879,"I love making games! Do you?"))</span> emits <span class='inline_code'>sayLine("11879:I love making games! Do you?")</span> <div class='line_break'></div> A marker of <span class='inline_code'>0</span> mean the text has not been extracted to the <span class='inline_code'>.tsv</span> file yet. <div class='line_break'></div> Text that begins with a <span class='inline_code'>^</span> won't be translated. <div class='line_break'></div> Turning on <span class='inline_code'>Translation Markers</span> in the Options panel will produce good information for debugging. </div></div></div><p class='copyright'>Copyright 2020 Terrible Toybox, Inc.
