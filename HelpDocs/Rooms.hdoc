@title Room Functions

 A `room` is basically a screen that `objects` and `actors` can be placed into.  A room also has `walkboxes` that define the pathing
 an `actor` can use when walking around.

 The tool [[`Wimpy`]](wimpy) is used to define the visual characteristic of a room and it's `objects`

 The `enterRoom()` command changes rooms and there is a global `currentRoom` variable that always hold the current room.
